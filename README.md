# Daily-Nurse-Staffing
I performed an in-depth analysis of the CMS Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) Daily Nurse Staffing dataset (2024Q1) to provide insights into contractor usage across states and facilities. My analysis focused on identifying trends in contractor-to-employee staffing ratios and contractor role utilization (Registered Nurses (RN), Licensed Practical Nurses (LPN), Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA), and Med Aides). The goal was to provide data-driven recommendations for sales efforts, helping Clipboard Health target states, facilities, and specific roles with the highest contractor staffing needs.
